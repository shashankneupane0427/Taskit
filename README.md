Taskit is a simple and elegant to-do list application built with React. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently with features like adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.

## Features

-   **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks with ease. Tasks are saved locally for persistence.
-   **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks to reflect any changes.
-   **Delete Tasks**: Remove unwanted tasks from the list.
-   **Mark as Completed**: Mark tasks as finished to keep track of progress.
-   **Show/Hide Completed Tasks**: Filter tasks to focus only on pending ones or view all.

## Demo

You can try the live version of Taskit [here](#) (Add link once deployed).

## Tech Stack

-   **React**: Frontend library
-   **CSS**: Styling
-   **UUID**: For generating unique task IDs
-   **LocalStorage**: To persist tasks across browser sessions
